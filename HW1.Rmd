## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library("readxl")
my_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Megan Jia/Documents/WI20.xlsx")
head(my_data)

```

```{r}
my_data['YEAR_BUILT_027']

```
